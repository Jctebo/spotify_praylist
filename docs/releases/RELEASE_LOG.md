# Release Log

## Enhancement 000: Morning Prayer Fragment Migration
- Moved Morning Prayer planning from the legacy audio-composition path toward the two-list Opus Dei + Detailed Fragments model.
- Captured the migration boundary for Morning Prayer, including the required fragment set and the need to avoid orphaned legacy fragment rows.
- Documented the related Notion fragment-view recipe so the new detailed-fragments database stays readable and ordered.

## Enhancement 001: Ordered Playlist Audio and Managed Truncation
- Standardized ordered `Playlist Audio` exports around top-level `Order` while keeping Morning Prayer's working page-body behavior intact.
- Added managed daily truncation so stale playlist-audio files disappear before the rebuild and sync step.
- Preserved the mixed text-sync model so reliable text sources can sync without breaking established writers.

## Enhancement 002: Order-First Playlist Naming
- Updated ordered `Playlist Audio` filenames so the order token comes first in the stem.
- Kept the same spaced separator style and continued using the shared top-level `Order` contract for queueing and export naming.
- Required `Output Folder` for ordered exports and retained managed truncation before sync.

## Enhancement 003: Romcal Overlay and Special Sunday Normalization
- Added a synthetic Romcal child calendar overlay that inherits from the requested calendar and applies explicit special-Sunday normalization rules.
- Normalized the Easter Octave pseudo-rank and expanded the devotional-image allowlist so it can recognize the special celebration state.
- Added regression coverage for named special Sundays, Easter Octave, Christmas, Pentecost, Christ the King, and ordinary Sundays.

## Bug 001: Daily Novena Stale-Audio Regeneration
- Fixed the daily novena audio workflow so reruns rebuild the managed novena audio subtree cleanly.
- Added regression coverage for the stale-audio rerun case.
- Updated the README and progress notes to describe the cleanup behavior.
- Verified the fix with `py -3 -m unittest tests.test_novena_job`, `py -3 -m unittest tests.test_page_audio_job`, and the full test suite.

## Bug 002: Daily Novena Legacy Prefetch Cleanup
- Made the legacy OneDrive novena prefetch explicitly optional.
- The daily novena workflow now skips the legacy copy when `DEVOTIONAL_ONEDRIVE_REMOTE_ROOT` is unset.
- Updated the README and progress notes to document the opt-in legacy path.
- Verified the workflow locally and with a remote GitHub Actions run that logged the skip message instead of the missing-root error.

## Notes
- This file initializes the `docs/releases/` contract from the prior `release/releaselog.md` source.
- Historical context still exists in git history if deeper detail is needed.

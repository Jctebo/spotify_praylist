# Release Log

## Bug 001: Daily Novena Stale-Audio Regeneration
- Fixed the daily novena audio workflow so reruns rebuild the managed novena audio subtree cleanly.
- Added regression coverage for the stale-audio rerun case.
- Updated the README and progress notes to describe the cleanup behavior.
- Verified the fix with `py -3 -m unittest tests.test_novena_job`, `py -3 -m unittest tests.test_page_audio_job`, and the full test suite.

## Bug 002: Daily Novena Legacy Prefetch Cleanup
- Made the legacy OneDrive novena prefetch explicitly optional.
- The daily novena workflow now skips the legacy copy when `DEVOTIONAL_ONEDRIVE_REMOTE_ROOT` is unset.
- Updated the README and progress notes to document the opt-in legacy path.
- Verified the workflow locally and with a remote GitHub Actions run that logged the skip message instead of the missing-root error.

## Notes
- The shipped bug docs remain available under `docs/bug_001` and `docs/bug_002`.
- This log is the concise release-facing summary of the bug work that shipped on the branch.
